# The Mousetrap (or just The Trap)


She opened the heavy door and peered around it into the black room. There were only two sources of light: one cut in a knife-blade shape at and angle across the floor of cold stone, and the other a can-light from the ceiling which made a perfect circle at the exact center of the room like a small black-box theater stage. That light shown down cold and white on a perfect man.

He sat in a plain dark-stained wooden chair. He was completely naked, and sat as if modeling for a painter. His pose seemed considered and careful, like with intention he had placed himself to best show the lines and shadows that laid out like a map drawn on his skin the balanced proportions of his honed muscles, sinew, and bone that traveled beneath the surface. His hands rested upon his knees, and his legs were casually parted. Between them, his cock stood high and hard. It was unblemished in any way, as smooth as the finest leather, and it had the gentle curve of a railroad track. It was long enough to remind her of a railroad track as well, traveling off to a distant vanishing point. But it was held firm at the base by the weighted pendulums of his testes.

He looked to be frozen and composed of stone, until he smiled a smile of marble-white teeth beneath his aquiline nose and gestured her towards him.

She closed the door behind her and the slash of light from it thinned and disappeared into the blackness of the corners. As she had been instructed, she wore nothing but a perfectly clean, perfectly white simple white cotton night-dress. Despite it's simplicity, her nipples projected through it in the cold air of the room, and it caught the way her body curved one way and then back again. As she moved slowly towards him, she felt bumps rise on the back of her legs. 

He smiled again, and held out an open hand towards the floor in front of him. It was a universal gesture, and she crossed her feet as she slipped to her knees. His knees parted and her hand came up and cupped his balls. They were warm and soft and rolled with slippery ease in her hand. Her lips opened and they slipped over the head of his warm and perfect cock as she let a long hot breath out of her nostrils that flowed upwards over the stony skin of his belly. She began to move her wet lips slowly down the shaft with her eyes closed.

It was when she realized that she had taken in almost as much of him as she could that she slowly opened her eyes. They had adjusted to the dim light, and from her new vantage on her knees she could now see that the simple wooden chair rested on some kind of metal mechanism. She lifted her head slightly, and saw that the mechanism was a balanced metal platform that rose off the floor by a few inches. The chair was set on the very center of this platform and a bar of metal seemed to be holding the platform back to it's position.

She lifted her head and saw that the bar ran back into the darkness, where it passed over some huge metal springs on the floor, and then over another heavy bar of metal held down by the one that propped the platform for the chair. Her mind did some quick calculations of the physics of the space and realized that the heavy spring-loaded bar was set so that with just the slightest too much pressure on the chair, the whole mechanism would be released and the heavy bar would snap down on her, laying a line of death straight across her spine. Her mathematical mind could calculate that in her current position it was set to pass completely by the man, and only strike her.

The perfect man in the chair was growing impatient with her slow process of realization. He gestured again to his throbbing wet cock in front of her with his hard open hand, without the smile this time. She slowly eased her head down and wrapped her lips around his cock again. It seemed this time that his cock was cold and hard, like the metal bars that were held back so precariously around her. She knew he had complete power over her --- all he needed to do was make the slightest movement downwards and it was over for her. She knew she needed to make him cum, that was the only way he would let her walk away. 

In her mind all she could see was her own end. The heavy bar whipping through the air and coming down on her, splitting her like a dropped ripe fruit. Her mind dwelt on the feeling --- at least it would be quick... and painless she hoped. Though it was possible the bar would not snap her spine entirely and she would writhe in agony, her two halves held together only by a thread of screaming pain. And she would watch her bleached white night-shirt pooling and absorbing her crimson blood.

She tried desperately to focus on his cock, to make him love the feeling of her sliding mouth on on it, to will his cum from it. She tried to push aside the images of her own end running through her head, and put instead the feeling of his burning cum filling her mouth, and sliding over her gently moving tongue and down her throat. At the same time she held back so much! Normally it was easy for her to get a man off. She took pride in it. But here, she moved ever so gently, afraid of setting off the trap, trying so hard to make him cum with the minimum movement possible.

And it was at that moment that she realized how turned on she was. Her pussy was wet enough she could feel it between her legs. She fought in her mind with herself about whether she dared to touch herself in this situation? What if that was the least movement that was needed to set off the trap? Her mind wrestled back and forth with itself, between pleasure and death. She understood the longing of the mouse for the food, though she was jealous that the mouse could risk his life for the pleasure of the food without realizing he was doing so.

She couldn't hold back the pleasure anymore. She slid one hand between her legs and touched herself, and almost immediately started to orgasm. She tried desperately to hold back her convulsions with terrible fear, but at the same time it seemed these extra movements were exactly what he needed, and his cum flooded her mouth.

As he came, the chair rocked precariously on it's low platform.
