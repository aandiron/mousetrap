# The Mouse Takes the Cheese


She opened the heavy door and peered around it into the black room. Inside there were only two sources of light: one from the door she had opened, cutting a knife-blade shape across the floor of cold stone, and the other a can-light from the ceiling which made a perfect circle at the exact center of the room, like the lighting of a small black-box theater stage. That circle of light shown down cold and white on a perfect man.

He sat in a plain dark-stained wooden chair. He was completely naked, and sat as if modeling for a painter. He had posed himself with careful consideration, with the intention to best display the lines and shadows that were drawn like a topographic map on his skin showing the balanced proportions of the honed muscles, sinew, and bone that traveled beneath the surface. His hands rested upon his knees, and his legs were casually parted. Between them, his cock stood high and hard. 

It was a cock unblemished in any way, as smooth as a fine suede, and with the gentle curve of a railroad track. It was also long enough to remind her of a railroad track, traveling off to a distant vanishing point. The base was held firm by the weighted pendulums of his testes. For a moment, she took him to be composed of stone, until a smile of marble-white teeth cracked beneath his aquiline nose and he gestured her towards him.

She closed the door behind her and the slash of light from it thinned and disappeared into the blackness of the corners. As she had been instructed, she wore nothing but a simple cotton night-dress that came down to just below the curve of her ass, perfectly clean and nearly glowing white under the light above her. Despite its simplicity, her nipples projected through it in the cool air of the room, and the cotton was flimsy enough to catch the way her body curved one way and then back again. As she moved slowly towards him, she felt bumps rise on the back of her legs. 

He smiled again, and held out an open hand towards the floor in front of him. It was a universal gesture, and she crossed her ankles as she slipped to her knees. His legs parted and her hand came up and cupped his balls. They were warm and soft and rolled with slippery ease in her fingers. Her lips opened and slipped over the head of his warm and bulging cock as she let out a long hot breath from her nostrils that flowed upwards over the stony skin of his belly. She began to move her wet lips slowly down the shaft with her eyes closed.

It was when she had taken in almost as much of him as she could, just before beginning her upstroke, that she slowly opened her eyes. They had adjusted to the dim light, and from her new vantage on her knees she could now see that the simple wooden chair he sat on rested on some kind of metal mechanism. She lifted her head slightly, his cock still between her lips and saw that the mechanism was a metal platform, balancing delicately on a fulcrum and raising the chair off the floor by a few inches. The chair was set on the very center of this platform and a half-inch thick bar of steel seemed to be holding the platform to its set position on the point of the fulcrum.

Curious, she lifted her head from his cock and held it in one warm little hand. She could now see that the bar of steel ran back into the darkness, where it passed over a taut coil of huge metal springs crossing the floor, and then over another heavy steel bar. The coil of springs were wound very tight, pressing the bar at the back up hard against the bar that held the fulcrum of the chair platform. The whole thing was apparently rigged so that just the slightest movement of the chair would release the restraining bar, which in turn would unleash the spring-loaded bar to snap over the man's head and down upon her.

She was excellent at spatial relations. Her mind did some quick calculations of the physics of the mechanism and she realized that it had been carefully designed to pass over the man safely, and come down at his feet. In her current position it would instantaneously lay down a line of death down straight across her spine.

The perfect man in the chair was growing impatient with her slow process of realization. He gestured again to his throbbing wet cock in front of her with his hard open hand, without the smile this time. She slowly eased her head down and wrapped her lips around his cock again. It seemed this time that his cock was unyielding and exothermic, like the metal bars held back so precariously around her. She knew he had complete power of life and death over her. His slightest movement, a casual rocking backwards, the way any sitting person might lean back in their chair just to have a little stretch, would flick out the small light of her life. She knew she needed to make him cum. That was the only way he would let her walk away. 

In her mind all she could see was her own end. The heavy bar whipping through the air and coming down on her back, splitting her like a dropped ripe fruit. Her mind dwelt on the feeling: at least it would be quick... and painless, she hoped. It occurred to her it was possible the bar would not snap her spine entirely and she would writhe in agony, her two halves held together only by a thread of electric pain. And she would watch her bleached white night-shirt pooling and absorbing her steaming blood the bar permanently pinned her to the unforgiving cold stone of the floor.

She tried desperately to focus on his cock, to make him love the feeling of her sliding mouth on on it, to will his cum from it. She tried to push aside the images of her own end, and replace them with the feeling of his burning cum filling her mouth and sliding over her gently moving tongue and down her throat. At the same time she held back so much. Normally it was easy for her to get a man off. She took pride in it. She usually applied a lot of movement. She made a show of it, noisily and hungrily sucking cock like a child with a frozen Popsicle. But here, she moved ever so gently, terrified of setting off the trap, trying to reach an end with the minimum movement possible.

But her effort to escape the trap became exponentially more complex the moment that she realized how turned on she was. She could feel her sopping pussy between her legs. She fought with herself about whether she dared to touch herself in this situation. What if moving her hand between her legs offset her balance against his cock in just the right way to set off the trap? Her mind wrestled back and forth, caught between pleasure and death. She suddenly understood the longing of the mouse for the food. And at the same time she was jealous that the mouse could risk his life for the pleasure of the food without consciousness that he was doing so.

Pleasure won over death. Her lust came at her in an unstoppable way, like something raised by a tidal force. She slid one hand between her legs, and almost immediately started to orgasm. Her muscles tensed, and her toes pushed back against the stone floor. Out of all-consuming fear, she tried desperately to keep her convulsions under a tight restraint of movement. At the same time it seemed these extra movements that seeped through to his cock were exactly what he needed. 

His cum flooded her mouth.

As he came, his head led slightly backwards the arc of his spine. And the center of the chair's gravity teetered precariously across the point that supported the little platform.
